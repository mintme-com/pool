## Open Source MintMe.com Coin Mining Pool

What follows next is the basic short guide. Main page of the project is located at https://webchain.network. If you have a need to learn how to install in a more detailed way, we invite you to read our <b>[Guide on Wiki](https://github.com/webchain-network/webchain-pool/wiki/Detailed-guide-about-MintMe.com Coin-pool-installation)</b>

### Features

* Support for Stratum mining
* Detailed block stats with luck percentage and full reward
* Failover webchaind instances: webchaind high availability built in
* Modern beautiful Ember.js frontend
* Separate stats for workers: can highlight timed-out workers so miners can perform maintenance of rigs
* JSON-API for stats
* Variable difficulty

### Building on Linux

Dependencies:

  * go >= 1.8
  * webchaind
  * redis-server >= 2.8.0
  * nodejs
  * nginx

**I highly recommend to use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.**

First install  [webchaind](https://github.com/webchain-network/webchaind/releases).

Clone & compile:

    git clone https://github.com/webchain-network/webchain-pool.git
    cd webchain-pool
    make

Install redis-server.

### Running Pool

    ./build/bin/webchain-pool config.json

You can use Ubuntu upstart - check for sample config in <code>upstart.conf</code>.

### Building Frontend

Install nodejs. I suggest using LTS version >= 4.x from https://github.com/nodesource/distributions or from your Linux distribution.

The frontend is a single-page Ember.js application that polls the pool API to render miner stats.

    cd www

Change <code>ApiUrl: '//example.net/'</code> in <code>www/config/environment.js</code> to match your domain name. Also don't forget to adjust other options.

    npm install -g ember-cli@2.4.3
    npm install -g bower
    npm install
    bower install
    ./build.sh

Configure nginx to serve API on <code>/api</code> subdirectory.
Configure nginx to serve <code>www/dist</code> as static website.

#### Serving API using nginx

Add this setting after <code>location /</code>:

	location /api {
		if ($request_uri ~* "/api/(.*)") {
			proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:8080/apietc/$1;
		}
	}

#### Customization

You can customize the layout using built-in web server with live reload:

    ember server --port 8082 --environment development

**Don't use built-in web server in production**.

Check out <code>www/app/templates</code> directory and edit these templates
in order to customise the frontend.

### Configuration

Configuration is actually simple, just read it twice and think twice before changing defaults.

**Don't copy config directly from this manual. Use the example config from the package,
otherwise you will get errors on start because of JSON comments.**

```

If you are distributing your pool deployment to several servers or processes,
create several configs and disable unneeded modules on each server. (Advanced users)

I recommend this deployment strategy:

* Mining instance - 1x (it depends, you can run one node for EU, one for US, one for Asia)
* Unlocker and payouts instance - 1x each (strict!)
* API instance - 1x

### Notes

* Unlocking and payouts are sequential, 1st tx go, 2nd waiting for 1st to confirm and so on. You can disable that in code. Carefully read `docs/PAYOUTS.md`.
* Also, keep in mind that **unlocking and payouts will halt in case of backend or node RPC errors**. In that case check everything and restart.
* You must restart module if you see errors with the word *suspended*.
* Don't run payouts and unlocker modules as part of mining node. Create separate configs for both, launch independently and make sure you have a single instance of each module running.
* If `poolFeeAddress` is not specified all pool profit will remain on coinbase address. If it specified, make sure to periodically send some dust back required for payments.
